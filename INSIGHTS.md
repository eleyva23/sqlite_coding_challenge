Tools Used for Challange.sql
Tool Used: Visual Studio Code with the SQLTools SQLite extension connected to baisdata.db.
-- Validation Approach:
--   1. Verified table schemas using PRAGMA table_info(table_name) to ensure correct column names.
--  2. inspected output via the SQLTools results panel.
 --3. Used code such as (SUM, COUNT, AVG) by manually re-running filtered queries 
   to confirm accuracy of groupings and calculations.
 Ensured consistency by comparing results against expected rankings and totals for each task.
 --4. also used "run query" to ensure each step ran seamlessly 


Task One- Top 5 Customers With Lifetime Spend 
Jacob Foster is the highets spender with speniding $8,722.67 followed by Ethan Gomesz at $8,206.19.

The top 5 customers shows that they all spent a disproptionat range between their life time with us. The lowest being Emma young contributing $4,409.83. This shows us who we should focus on in our data. 

Task Two- Revenue by Product Category
The Electronic category is our highest grossing category nearly doubling the sceond. Electronics made a revenue of $25,364.23, this by almost double is our top product compared to the rest. 

The lowest categories grocery and stationary shows us our deman dis focused on electronics despite the variety of products we offer. 

Task Three- Employees Earning above Department Average 
In this data we see that we have a variety of departments earning above the Department average. Meaning we have a varity of employeess in different daprtments that are motivated to over acahieve. 

However, the list is not big meaning a lot of other employess need more incentives of are fighting harder compensation bands. 

Task Four- Cities with the most loyal customers 
Tampa is showing for our most loyal customers in the gold bracket making up for four customers in that area. follwoing Brandon with only one sutomer in the silver bracket. This indicates that we have a main clinetel based in the tampa bay area. Showing a favoritism for the south Florida region.

For marketing insights we have no other gold customers other than oin Tampa. This suggestion that we should market more the South Florida regions for cities like Sarasota and St.Petersburg. I also suggest we focus on more marketing for the state of Florida to raise our gold customers numbers.
